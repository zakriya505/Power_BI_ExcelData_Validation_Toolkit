Project: PowerBI-Excel Validation Toolkit
Role: Data Validation Engineer
Summary: Implemented an automated validation pipeline (Python: pandas, numpy, openpyxl; Excel; Power BI) to reconcile P&L, sales, COGS and market-share metrics across sources and produce auditable validation reports.
Key Contributions: Developed COMPREHENSIVE_VALIDATION.py to automate cross-sheet checks, generate FINAL_VALIDATION_REPORT.md, and document data provenance for stakeholder review.
Impact: Reduced manual verification effort, improved data quality and reporting confidence by enabling reproducible, auditable validation workflows.
